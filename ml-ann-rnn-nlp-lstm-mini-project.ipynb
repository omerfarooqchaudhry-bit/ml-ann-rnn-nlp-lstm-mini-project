    "In this mission, you will use a text from Shakespeare (Shakespeare’s first sonnet) to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) for language modelling.\n",
    "You can use any editor such as Jupyter Notebook or Spyder, to complete this mission in your computer.\n",
    "Write code that uses the Keras library to build, train, and test an RNN with the architecture described.\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    " Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, and removing punctuations might help, though maintaining the structure could be beneficial.\n",
    " Data Augmentation: Consider supplementing with other poetic or classical text sources.\n",
    " Model Choice: Use LSTMs or GRUs instead of simple RNNs to handle long-term dependencies.\n",
    " Regularization: Apply dropout to mitigate overfitting.\n",
    " Evaluation: Use perplexity or BLEU scores to assess generated text quality.\n",
